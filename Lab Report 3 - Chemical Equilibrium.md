## Part I. Equilibria of Complex Ions

$$\ce{Fe^3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) <=> FeSCN^2+(aq)}$$

(pale yellow $\rightarrow$ deep read)

1. Place $\pu{1 mL}$ of $\pu{0.2 M \ce{Fe(NO3)3}}$ and $\pu{1 mL}$ of $\pu{0.1 M \ce{KSCN}}$ in two different test tubes. These will serve as your stock solutions and allow you to work from your benche without having to retrieve more.
2. Preparation of the $\ce{Fe(SCN)^2+}$  solution:
   1. Add $\pu{12 mL}$ of DI water to a $\pu{50 mL}$ Erlenmeyer flask. To this flask, add 10 drops of $\pu{0.2 M \ce{Fe(NO3)3}}$ and 5 drops of $\pu{0.1 M \ce{KSCN}}$ from the 2 stock solution test tubes you prepared in step 1. Mix the solution in the Erlenmeyer well with a disposable pipet. Record the color of the solution.
   2. Make sure that you can see through the solution; if the color is too dark you will have trouble observing any color changes as you proceed. You may continue to dilute the solution if it looks too dark. The volume given here is a general guideline.
   3. Place four $\pu{3 mL}$ portions of this solution into four separate test tubes.
3. Add different reagents to the test tubes containing the $\ce{Fe(SCN)^2+}$ solution and record any color changes observed:
   1. To the first test tube of $\ce{Fe(SCN)^2+}$ add \pu{0.5 mL} of \pu{0.2 M \ce{Fe(NO3)3}} from the stock solution test tube.
   2. To the second test tube of $\ce{Fe(SCN)^2+}$ add $\pu{0.5 mL}$ of $\pu{0.1 M \ce{KSCN}}$ from the stock solution test tube.
   3. To the third test tube of $\ce{Fe(SCN)^2+}$ slowly add $\pu{6 M \ce{NaOH}}$ solution drop-wise. You will notice two changes. You should address this in Question A below.
   4. Use the last test tube of $\ce{Fe(SCN)^2+}$ as a reference for comparison.

### Cleanup
- Pour the content from the test tubes into the waste container in the fume hood labeled "Cation Metal Waste."

   3. Use the third test tube as a reference.

### Cleanup

- Save the $\ce{HCl}$ solution until the ened of the experiment.

## Part III. Equilibria of Weak Acids and Bases

$$\ce{HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + C2H3O2-(aq)}$$

$$\ce{NH3(aq) + H2O(l) <=> NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)}$$

### Procedure for the acetic acid/acetate ion equilibrium
1. Place $\pu{3 mL}$ of $\pu{0.1 M}$ acetic acid into each of three test tubes. You will make this solution from $\pu{6 M}$ stock solution. Add two drops of methyl orange to each test tube. Observe the color of the solutions.
2. To one of these test tubes add $\pu{1.0 M \ce{NaC2H3O2}}$ a few drops at a time and observe any color changes. Remember to mix the solution well after each addition. To another test tube, add $\pu{6 M}$ acetic acid a few drops at a time and observe any color changes. Again mix well after each addition. Repeat this step with another sample to confirm your results.

### Procedure for the ammonia/ammonium ion equilibrium

3. Place $\pu{3 mL}$ of $\pu{0.1 M}$ ammonium hydroxide into the other three test tubes. You will make this from $\pu{6 M}$ stock solution. Add two drops of phenolphthalein indicator to each tube. Observe the color of the solutions.
4. To one of these test tubes add $\pu{1 M \ce{NH4Cl}}$ a few drops at a time and observe any color changes. Remember to mix the soltuion well after each addition. Add more $\pu{6 M}$ ammonium hydroxide to the test tube a few drops at a time. Mix well after each addition and note any color changes.
5. To another test tube containing ammonium hydroxide, add $\pu{6 M \ce{HCl}}$ a few drops at a time and observe any color changes. Remember to mix the solution well after each addition.

### Cleanup

- Save the $\ce{HCl}$ solution until the end of the experiment.
- Using a small stream of no more than $\pu{1 mL}$ of DI water per tube, rinse the contents of the test tubes into the $\pu{800 mL}$ beaker. Save this solution until Part V.
